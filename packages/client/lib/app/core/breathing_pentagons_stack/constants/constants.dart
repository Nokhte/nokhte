/// This is a barrel file for the `constants` folder, providing easy access to
/// various constants used throughout the application related to breathing
/// pentagons animation.
///
/// The following files are exported from this barrel:
///
///  - `pentagon_colors.dart`: This file contains the color constants used for
///    the pentagons' gradient colors during the animation.
///
///  - `pentagon_painter_helper.dart`:
///
///  - `pentagon_angles.dart`: This file contains constants related to the angles
///    used in the animation of the breathing pentagons.
///
///  - `types/types.dart`: This file contains custom type definitions used in
///    various parts of the application.
///
///  - `movies/movies.dart`: This file is a collection of pre-defined animations
///    (movies) for the breathing pentagons, such as `AggressiveExpansion` and
///    `InfiniteSpinner`.
///
/// By importing this `constants.dart` barrel file for easy access all
/// the relevant constants and utility methods needed for the breathing pentagon
/// animations without having to import each file individually. This enhances
/// code readability and maintainability by centralizing all the constants and
/// helper functions under a single entry point.
