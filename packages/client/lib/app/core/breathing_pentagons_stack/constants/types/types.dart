/// This barrel file exports the `MovieModes` enum from the `movie_modes.dart`
///
/// The `MovieModes` enum defines the different 'movies' for the
/// `BreathingPentagonsStateTracker mobx store. Each movie mode represents a
/// specific animation behavior for the button to be tracked in the mobx store.
///
/// This barrel file allows for easy access to the `MovieModes` enum from other
/// parts of the codebase, simplifying the import process and promoting code
/// organization.
